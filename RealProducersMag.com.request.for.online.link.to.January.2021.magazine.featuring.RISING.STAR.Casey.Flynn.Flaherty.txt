DO YOU HAVE AN ONLINE VERSION FEATURING "RISING STAR" CASEY FLYNN FLAHERTY IN THE JANUARY 2021 ISSUE OF GREATER LOUISVILLE REAL PRODUCER MAGAZINE? IF SO, COULD YOU PLEASSE SEND ME A LINK. I TRIED YOUR SITE BUT NOTHING SHOWS UP FOR THE ENTIRE STATE OF KENTUCKY.

MY SON, CASEY FLYNN FLAHERTY, WAS FEATURED IN YOUR JANUARY 2021 AND I, AS SEGREST-FLAHERTY's "ADMIN", Admin@SegrestGroup.com , WANTED TO UPDATE OUR WEBSITES TO SHOW HIS "RISING STAR" FEATURE YOU WERE ALL SO NICE AND COOL TO DO FOR HIM. HE IS HUMBLE STILL AND THAT MAKES ME HAPPIEST OF ALL, BUT I DO SO MUCH APPRECIATE YOUR MOST PUREHEART ENCOURAGEMENT FOR MY GENTLE BABY MAN. THANK YOU ALL.

... ROLLING WITH THE FATNESS ... YOU DON'T EVEN KNOW WHAT THE HALF IS ... NO DIGGITY ... https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3KL9mRus19o&t=115 ... NO DAP ...

THANK YOU ALL ... YOU CAN SHAKE YOUR HEAD AND SMILE NOW :-)

Blessed are the PUREHEART
for they shall see G_D.
Matthew 5:8
