TRUTH, the True Vine

1 “I AM the true vine, and G_D is the keeper of the vineyard. 2 G_D cuts off every branch in TRUTH that bears no fruit, and every branch that does bear fruit, G_D prunes to make it even more fruitful. 3 You are already clean because of the WORD I have spoken to you. 4 Remain in TRUTH, and G_D will remain in you. Just as no branch can bear fruit by itself unless it remains in the vine, neither can you bear fruit unless you remain in TRUTH.

5 I AM the vine and you are the branches. The one who remains in TRUTH, and G_D in him, will bear much fruit. For apart from TRUTH, apart from G_D you can do nothing. 6 If anyone does not remain in TRUTH, she or he is like a branch that is thrown away and withers. Such branches are gathered up, thrown into the fire, and burned. 7 If you remain in TRUTH and G_D's WORD remains in you, ASK WHATEVER YOU WISH, AND IT WILL BE DONE FOR YOU ... https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nQJACVmankY ... 8 This is to G_D’s glory, that you bear much fruit, proving yourselves to be My disciples.

No Greater Love

9 As G_D has loved TRUTH, so have I loved you. Remain in G_D's LOVE. 10 If you keep G_D's commandments, you will remain in G_D's LOVE, just as I have kept G_D’s commandments and remain in G_D's LOVE. 11 I have told you these things so that G_D's joy may be in you and your joy may be complete.

12 This is G_D's commandment, that you LOVE ONE ANOTHER AS I HAVE LOVED YOU. 

13 GREATER LOVE HAS NO ONE THAN THIS, THAT SHE OR HE WILL LAY DOWN HER OR HIS LIFE FOR HER OR HIS FRIENDS.

14You are my friends if you do what G_D commands you. 15 No longer do I call you servants, for a servant does not understand what his master is doing. But I have called you friends, because everything I have learned from G_D I have made known to you. 16 You did not choose G_D, but G_D chose you. And G_D appointed you to go and bear fruit—fruit that will remain—so that whatever you ask G_D in TRUTH, G_D will give you. 17 This is G_D's command to you: LOVE ONE ANOTHER.

The Hatred of the World

18 If the world hates you, understand that it hated TRUTH first. 19 If you were of the world, it would love you as its own. Instead, the world hates you, because you are not of the world, but G_D has chosen you out of the world.

20 Remember the WORD that I spoke to you: ‘No servant is greater than his master.’a If they persecuted me, they will persecute you as well; if they kept my WORD, they will keep yours as well. 21 But they will treat you like this because of TRUTH, since they do not know G_D who sent me. 22 IF I HAD NOT COME AND SPOKEN TO THEM, THEY WOULD NOT BE GUITY OF SIN. NOW, HOWEVER, THEY HAVE NO EXCUSE FOR THEIR SIN.

23 Whoever hates TRUTH hates G_D as well. 24 If I had not done among them the works that no one else did, they would not be guilty of sin; but now they have seen and hated both TRUTH and G_D. 25 But this is to fulfill what is written in 'their law': ‘They hated me, TRUTH, without reason.’

26 When the advocate comes, whom I will send to you from the Father—the Spirit of truth who proceeds from the Father—G_D will testify about TRUTH. 27And you also must testify, because you have been with TRUTH from the beginning.
