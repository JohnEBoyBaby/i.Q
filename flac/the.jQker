Pompatus (or Pompitus) (/ˈpɒmpətəs/) is a nonce word famously coined by Steve Miller in his 1973 hit single "The Joker". The word is probably a corruption of — or imagined variation on — the word "puppetutes", which was itself an coinage, originated by Vernon Green at the age of 14. Green included the word “puppetutes” in the lyrics of a doo-wop song released in 1954, "The Letter," which was performed by him and The Medallions. “The Letter” also included another original coinage, "pismotality." Presumably in homage to the Medallions’ song, Steve Miller used the nonce words "epismetology" and "pompatus” in the lyrics of two of his other songs, "Enter Maurice" and "The Conversation," one of which is, like “The Letter,” in spoken-word style. The appealing oddness of the phrase "the pompatus of love” garnered a lot of attention, and inspired its use by others. For example, it was used as the title of a movie.[1]

Vernon Green (May 1, 1937 – December 24, 2000) was the American leader of the rhythm and blues band The Medallions. He wrote the 1954 song, "The Letter", which contained the nonsense lyric, "the puppetuse of love." According to an interview with Green, puppetutes was "A term I coined to mean a secret paper-doll fantasy figure [thus puppet], who would be my everything and bear my children."
