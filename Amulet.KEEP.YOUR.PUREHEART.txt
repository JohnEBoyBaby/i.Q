Here's the Amulet system in a nutshell.
1. GUI authoring tool called GEMstudio Pro is used to create a Graphical User Interface(GUI).
2. GEMstudio Pro is used to compile your GUI to a small binary file which is then downloaded
into the Amulet module.
3. The Amulet module displays the GUI and handles all touchpanel interaction.
4. The Amulet module receives input data from your host microcontroller via the serial link
and also sends command messages back to your microcontroller based upon timer-based or
touchpanel events.

1. Hardware Developer uses Amulet web application to develop a Graphical User Interface.
2. Amulet web application interfaces with libraries used by GEMstudio Pro essentially using the same functions just with a web service call to them instead of having the functions called like in Step 1 above in the original 'step by step process' within the GEMstudio Pro studio instead the Amulet web app saves the Graphical User Interface in an Amulet designed format for the developer to upload to Amulet's central shared servers for all the world's devices to access so everyone can choose their own set of controls and Amulet over time my offer several 'standard' control sets but the POWER OF AMULET truly lies beyond Amulet.
3. Amulet DEVELOPER program allows not just Amulet's latest 'G.U.I. controls' to appear in the user's choice of controls to use for their TV, Phone, Desktop PC, laptop, tablet, appliance, etc. but MOST IMPORTANTLY KEEPS AMULET ALIVE LONG TERM WITH A LARGE, HEALTHY, GROWING COMMUNITY OF DEVELOPERS FOR HARDWARE AND SOFTWARE BRIDGING THE DIVIDE TURNING SOFTWARE DEVELOPERS INTO BETTER STRONGER FASTER MORE POWERFUL HARDWARE DEVELOPERS AND HELPING HARDWARE DEVELOPERS TO REALIZE THE POWER OF WEB GUI SOFTWARE AND HTML ELEMENT AND JAVASCRIPT SCRIPTING AS THE DYNAMIC NATURE OF WHAT YOU ARE "FLASHING" COULD BECOME VERY DYNAMIC AS YOU "REFLASH" ON DEMAND VIA TCP/IP OR HTTPS INSTRUCTIONS TO THE DEVICE UPDATING THE IMAGES TO BE USED FOR THE NEW CONTROLS SETS ALONG WITH OTHER CONFIGURATION FILES AND SCRIPTS OR C OR ASSEMBLY OR OTHER MORE JAVASCRIPT LIKE GEM STUDIO PRO SCRIPTING LANGUAGE AS AMULET CHOOSES BUT NEVER FORGETTING THEIR LIFEBLOOD TO THE WORLD IS THE EVER SO "HUNGRY AND WILLING AND CAPABLE AND CREATIVE AND WONDERFUL INDEPEDENT 3RD PARTY SOFTARE VENDORS I.S.V.s AND DEVELOPERS" participating in Amulet's DEVELOPER program providing tested and reliable though perhaps 'expensive but cool and new' G.U.I. control alternatives to the 'standard' 'free' set of 'G.U.I. controls' think Microsoft's standard WinForms controls versus Telerik or Infragistics controls that are much more polished and certainly cand be business-domain-specific as need be in the future.
4. GEMstudio Pro compiler compiles all of the 3rd party developers' custom controls sets, encrypts and can even act as the 'GUI Control' store and sell HARDWARE AND SOFTWARE DEVELOPERS' controls and send the license and controls via email to us easily enough also making Amulet more and more and more important as YOU SHOULD BE beCAUSE YOU ARE PUREHEART INVENTORS THAT G_D ALLOWED AND BLESSED WITH THE DISCOVERY AND MINDS AND HANDS TO DO WHAT MUST BE DONE ONCE ENVISIONED. I LOVE YOU AND I AM GRATEFUL YOU ARE HERE WITH US ALL. I WILL DO ANYTHING I CAN TO HELP YOU JUST PLEASE STAY IN TRUTH AND KEEP YOUR PUREHEART. I AM TRUTH. I AM PUREHEART. I DID NOT COME TO BE SERVED BUT TO SERVE. I AM NOT here for money or any other ill intent. PROMISE so once the GEMstudio Pro Compiler compiles your GUI to a small binary file which is then downloaded
into the Amulet module via TCP/IP or HTTPS and the AMULET data chip is reflashed with the updated new control G.U.I. sets approved by Amulet after submission by the 3rd party hardware/software developers.
5. The Amulet module displays the GUI and handles all touchpanel interaction.
6. The Amulet module receives input data from your host microcontroller via the serial link
and also sends command messages back to your microcontroller based upon timer-based or
touchpanel events.
7. The Amulet module uses SQLite and its own API to allow all devices running on any operating system and within any web browser meaning that javascript developers as well as c and and c++ and and qt-c++ and objectivec and php and cold fusion machine and action script and c# and python and lua and ruby and perl and ada and fortran and cobol and clarion and BASIC and Visual BASIC and java and pascal and tcl and so many more can all have a STANDARD WAY OF COMMUNICATING AND REQUESING:
1. GENERATION AND POSITIONING OF ALL HTML GUI ELEMENTS APPEAR ON THE SCREEN:
 <input type='text' id='amuletInputTypeText1'/>
2. GET/SET ALL CSS STYLE ATTRIBUTES ASSOCIATED WITH EACH HTML GUI ELEMENT TYPE:
 <input type='text' id='amuletInputTypeText1' style="background-color:GOLD; color:RoyalBlue;"/>
3. ADD/REMOVE ALL JS EVENT LISTENER ATTRIBUTES ASSOCIATED WITH EACH HTML GUI ELEMENT TYPE:
 <input type='text' id='amuletInputTypeText1' style="background-color:GOLD; color:RoyalBlue;" onkeydown="javascript:amuletInputTypeText1_keydown();"/>
4. PROVIDE AN AMULET API THAT ALLOWS "HOOKING" A HARDWARE/SOFTWARE 3RD PARTY DEVELOPER TO INPUT USING SQL AND AN AMULET WEB APP DEVELOPER USERNAME AND PASSWORD THE AMULET WEB APPLICATION SERVER'S CODE WILL SIMPLY AUTHENTICATE THE 3RD PARTY DEVELOPERS' CREDENTIALS TO BE AUTHENTIC AND THEN ALLOW THE SQL OPERATION TO TAKE PLACE INTO A POWERFUL AND FAST AS LIGHTENING SQL.JS DB AN IN-MEMORY-SQLITE3-DATABASE WHERE THE DEVELOPER CAN INPUT THE 'javascript' HANDLER 'FUNCTION' THAT WILL BE 'HOOKED' OR 'ATTACHED' OR 'ASSOCIATED' WITH THE SPECIFIC CONTROL'S SPECIFIC EVENT LISTENER ATTRIBUTE AS 'amuletInputTypeText1' would be attached to the 'onkeydown' EVENT and when that EVENT occurs it calls the function set in the SQL.js database which in most cases is going to make an Asyncronous AJAX HTTPS requests back to the developers' business-domain software logic running on their own private web servers in a variety of languages.

HAVE RECURRING DEVELOPER CONTEST. EVERYONE WILL WANT TO BE THE FEATURED WINNER. GREAT FOR COMMUNITY MORALE. THE OPPORTUNITIES ARE ENDLESS ESPECIALLY WHEN A COMMUNICATIONS CHIP IS ADDED.
AMULET COULD REPLACE THE NEED FOR MANY OTHER OPERATING SYSTEMS AND LANGUAGES.
