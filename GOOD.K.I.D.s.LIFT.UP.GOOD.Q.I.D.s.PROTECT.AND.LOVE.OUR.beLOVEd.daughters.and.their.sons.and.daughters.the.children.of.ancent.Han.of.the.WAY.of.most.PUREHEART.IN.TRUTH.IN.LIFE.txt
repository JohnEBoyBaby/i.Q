LQQK CLQSELY WHAT DO YOU SEE ... ?

我 = I = Wǒ
 = can you see her?
我 們 = WE = Wǒmen = can you see her 'crossed legs' ancient Han of long ago 'left behind' to remind us of her most PUREHEART and how she gives meaning to LOVE and is worth working hard in the grid like patterned fields ...

I SEE YOU ... I See You ... i see you "kind" beLOVEd one ... 

Was she left behind to remind us of her grace, her beauty, her LOVE, her CHILDREN, her INTELLIGENCE,  of  'her'?

Why are the 'crossed legs' of a 'woman' 'female' found in 'number' and 'mathematics' ... hmmm?

NUMBER
數
 
 "see her 'crossed legs'" 數? SHE IS THERE FOR A REASON ... SHE IS A TEACHER ... 
... imagine man, Adam, version 1, Pentium I cpu machine ...
... imagine woman, built on top of base class, Adam, version 2, Pentium II cpu machine ... HIGHLY INTELLECTUAL ... HIGHLY VERSATILE ... and ever so graceful, gentle, nurturing, soft legs, loving, kind, sweet, smiling, laughing, singing, cooking, playing, inspiring all GOOD MEN who LOVE PUREHEART and G_D ...
https://translate.google.com/?sl=zh-CN&tl=en&text=數&op=translate

Could it be beCAUSE a natural woman's role was that of math, intellect, nurturing, teaching?

We can understand why 'woman' 'female' is found in 'daughter' and not son easily enough if we 'look' within ...

Ancient Han knew the role of a stronger, bigger, GOOD man, GOOD son, was to be a 'supporter'
just as the symbol for man and child is that of a 'support staff' 子 for their family and most of all for their beLOVEd natural intelligent nurturing loving 'female' 女 'woman' their mom

support
支持 see her 'crossed legs' to remind 'him' of 'her' and 'who he is supporting' working hard in the 'fields'
family

 a GOOD FAMILY walks TOGETHER and there she is ... I SEE YOU ... I See You ... i see you ...

Even 'child' alludes to a 'son' being the 'child' who will 'support' her 子

son of man
人子
https://translate.google.com/?sl=zh-CN&tl=en&text=人子&op=translate

which makes it easy to understand how the common part of 'woman' 女人 and the common part of 'son of man' 人子 common to both man and woman makes "MAN AND WOMAN" so perfectly

MAN AND WOMAN
人子
https://translate.google.com/?sl=zh-CN&tl=en&text=人女&op=translate

Making it very easy to understand how child and woman even references man and woman given 'woman' is his beLOVED soft 'crossed legs' and man is the 'support staff' 子 seen in 'man and woman' 人子 too
