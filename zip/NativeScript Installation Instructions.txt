NATIVESCRIPT INSTALLATION ON MAC FOR IOS

1. DOWNLOAD AND INSTALL THE LTS VERSION OF NODEJS AT https://nodejs.org/en/download/

 The NativeScript CLI quick setup lets you develop your apps locally, and test them on a physical Android or iOS device. This enables some pretty cool workflows, such as allowing you to develop iOS apps on Windows or Linux development machines.

 To enable this workflow and complete your setup, download and install the NativeScript Playground app on your mobile device. You can search for “NativeScript Playground” on the iOS App Store or Google Play, or use the links below.

 You can then go to the NativeScript playground by scanning the QR code using the NativeScript Playground app and preview your NativeScript app on the device.

https://play.nativescript.org/

4. Copy and paste the script below into your terminal and press Enter

ruby -e "$(curl -fsSL https://www.nativescript.org/setup/mac)"

The macOS script needs administrative access to run some commands using sudo; therefore, you may need to provide your password several times during execution. The macOS script also may take some time to complete, as it’s installing the dependencies for both iOS and Android development. When the script finishes, close and restart your terminal.

5. OPTIONAL to check NativeScript is installed successfully, open the TERMINAL app and run the following command then press ENTER

tns doctor

NOTE: If you see "No issues were detected" you are good to go!
